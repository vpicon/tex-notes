We often forget how much technology affects our view of systems [...] it frequently happens that a change in technology renders some idea obsolete and it quickly vanishes. However, another change in technology could revive it again. This is especially true when the change has to do with the relative performance of different parts of a system. [...] As a consequence of this impermance, look from time to time at ``obsolete'' concepts (ideas that are not optimal with current technology), which changes in technology may bring them back. It is important to understand why a concept is obsolete and what changes in the environment might bing it back again.
